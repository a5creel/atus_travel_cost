This is for my first (and maybe multiple) dissertation chapter. Of interest: substitution between indoor and outdoor rec under different climate scenarios 


## Data Wrangle 

Codes that I need: 

  - 1813.. : Travel Related to Sports, Exercise, and Recreation
    - currently just taking all of travel time... need to think about. 
  - 130000 : Sports, Exercise, and Recreation
    - WILL need to go through this and get more specific (some aren't outdoors)

NEXT STEP: 

  - Get total amount of time traveling to recreate and recreation time. 
  - solution to travel time: drop people on days who haven't done any outdoor rec activity (and then that non-correct rec travel time gets dropped too.)
